/// Base class for any Entity Mutator that works with Remote Storage. Remote storage â€“ any place with hight latency and asynchronious interface and splited communication. (Back-end server, cloud etc.). Splitted communications means that async modfication is only intent (not an real modification) and system should wait on notification that arrives via 'SSUpdateReceiversManaging' to ensure modification is applied. Mutator will match notification on modifiation by marker and will call it's handler.
/// - Note:
/// It's inheritors responsobility to provide storage modification logic (usually it's api calls). Also inheritor must implements notifications handling, usually it's just calling `handleUpdate(marker:error:)` method. See examples for more info.
/// - Important: Remote mutator count on some `Updater` working on `DispatchQueue.bg` queue. Methods works with `handlers` property may cause racecondition otherwise, cuz `mutate` dispatches to `DispatchQueue.bg` on it's own  and `handleUpdate` usually calls from reaction on update.
