/// Tool that incapsulates planning repeating job.
///
/// Use `scheduleNew(job:)` to schedule passed job after current Time Out. Initial TO calculated by passing 0 as steps to `timeCalculator`. Call `handler` that passed to `job` closure to affect timeout for next scheduled task. Scheduling new job, just after handler call - right way to plan next task. If next job schedulee erlier then `handler`'s call â€“ it will be scheduled after previous timeout ignoring strategy that will be passed to handler. If next job schedules some times later after `handler`'s call, it will be scheduled after newly calculated TO, ignoring some time already passed since `handler`'s call.
///
/// - Warning: Tool isn't thread safe. Provided executor used only for delayed task executing and not for synchronising internal state. That why:
/// * Handler passed to job, should be called withing same queue as `scheduleNew` do.
/// * User may be sure, that passed job will be executed within executor passed to init.
