Mutator will match notification on modifiation by marker and will call it's handler.
/// - Note:
/// It's inheritors responsobility to provide storage modification logic (usually it's api calls). Also inheritor must implements it's notifications handling by simply calling `handleUpdate(marker:error:)` method. See examples for more info.
